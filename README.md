## üîç SQL Queries

**1Ô∏è Monthly Revenue & Order Volume**
```sql
SELECT 
    STRFTIME('%Y', order_date) AS year,
    STRFTIME('%m', order_date) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS monthly_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_volume
FROM online_sales_large
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month;


 2. Top 3 Months by Sales

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    STRFTIME('%Y-%m', order_date) AS month_year,
    SUM(amount) AS monthly_revenue
FROM online_sales_large
GROUP BY month_year
ORDER BY monthly_revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;


 Interview Questions & Answers:
1Ô∏è.How do you group data by month and year?
Use SQL date functions to extract month and year, then GROUP BY:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    STRFTIME('%Y', order_date) AS year,
    STRFTIME('%m', order_date) AS month
FROM table
GROUP BY year, month;

2Ô∏è.What's the difference between COUNT(*) and COUNT(DISTINCT col)?

COUNT(*) ‚Üí Counts all rows, including duplicates and NULLs.

COUNT(DISTINCT col) ‚Üí Counts only unique, non-NULL values in that column.

3Ô∏è.How do you calculate monthly revenue?
Use SUM() on the revenue column grouped by month and year:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    SUM(amount) AS monthly_revenue
FROM table
GROUP BY year, month;

4Ô∏è.What are aggregate functions in SQL?
Functions that operate on a set of rows and return a single value:

SUM() ‚Üí Total sum of values

AVG() ‚Üí Average value

COUNT() ‚Üí Number of rows

MIN() ‚Üí Smallest value

MAX() ‚Üí Largest value

5Ô∏è.How to handle NULLs in aggregates?

Most aggregate functions ignore NULLs by default.

Use COALESCE(column, 0) to replace NULLs with 0 before aggregation.

6Ô∏è.What‚Äôs the role of ORDER BY and GROUP BY?

GROUP BY ‚Üí Combines rows with the same values into summary rows.

ORDER BY ‚Üí Sorts the output in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.

7Ô∏è.How do you get the top 3 months by sales?
Sort by total revenue in descending order and limit to 3 rows:

SELECT 
    STRFTIME('%Y-%m', order_date) AS month_year,
    SUM(amount) AS monthly_revenue
FROM table
GROUP BY month_year
ORDER BY monthly_revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;
